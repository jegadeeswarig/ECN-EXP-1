 To study and verify the Kirchhoff's law.

(a) To verify kirchhoff's voltage law.
Aim:-
The aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the voltage in their respective branches.

Objectives:-

Analyze closed loops in a circuit to apply KVL, ensuring the sum of voltages is zero.
To measure voltage in a circuit for each element.
To verify Kirchoff's Voltage Law by comparing theoretically calculated values with the practical one.
To understand the application of Kirchhoff’s law.

Steps to perform Kirchhoff's Voltage Law:-

STEP 1 : Make connections by dragging nodes from apparatus to the circuit.
   (a) Connect power supply to the circuit (1-9, 2-10).
   (b) Connect voltmeter (3-11, 4-12) and (5-13, 6-14) and (7-15, 8-16) or you can connect any voltmeter to any resistance in circuit.
   (c) Click on the label to delete all the connections for the corresponding nodes.
STEP 2 : Check your connections by clicking on the ‘CHECK’ button.
STEP 3 : Set the values of resistances R1, R2 & R3 by adjusting the sliders on left, these values will remain constant throughout the experiment.
STEP 4 : Click the ‘Power’ button to turn on the power supply.
STEP 5 : Now, vary the voltage value by moving the voltage slider to the right side, the readings on the voltmeter will change accordingly.
STEP 6 : Click on the ‘ADD’ button to add the readings to the observation table.
STEP 7 : Repeat steps 6 and 7 until we reach to the 6th reading (Minimum reading to be taken to plot the graph is 6).
STEP 8 : Click on the ‘PLOT’ button to display the graph.
STEP 9 : Click on ‘PRINT’ button to take out the print of the page.
STEP 10 : Click on ‘RESET’ button to refresh the page.
